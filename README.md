# Said-Husseini Self-Assessment
## Module 20 Individual Self-Assessment Deliverable

## Personal Role & Challenges
- The role I played within the project was facilitator and communication navigator.
- I was in charge of Tableau Data Visualizations, the Presentation and writing up the purpose of the project.
- I also helped my team members in the data preprocessing and cleaning.
- The team then used a method of communication based on each person's thoughts to craft and create the machine learning model.
- We also helped pick HTML5 themes, and I helped in creating and embedding the Tableau visualizations in the online dashboard. 

- My greatest personal challenge is to understand how the machine learning model can be applied to future datasets, the issue of choosing features and not overfitting the model is a tricky one, my understanding of how a prediction can be made on future data. I overcame that challenge by slowly asking questions and building a stronger understanding of how this works.

## Team Communication & Strengths

- We used Slack to facilitate team communication
- then we used Zoom to share our work
- We used Google collabs to share our code and to edit in real time
- We also used Google Slides to craft and work on share the presentation with each other
- Some challenges happened if people did not see slack messages, but we resolved them by using texts or WhatsApp.
- Our team was strong because we shared roles equally, played to everyone's individual strengths, we had strong coders and strong presenters and idea generators and strong researchers. so, the advice would be to collect a list of everyoneâ€™s strengths and weaknesses in a certain topic and go from there when working with the team for new cohorts.


## Project Pitch (LinkedIn)

- The topic we chose was analyzing and predicting flight delay using machine learning algorithms
- We are aiming to use many features to predict:
1. If a flight is delayed or not
2. How many minutes the flight will be delayed

- We used multiple linear regression models to predict the minutes and logistic regressions to predict the delayed or not

- The result of the analysis was successful, and we were able to get a top accuracy of 88% for predicting whether or not a flight is delayed
- As for the linear regressions, given future data we can match up to 0.97 R2 for most flights whether the delay is likely.
